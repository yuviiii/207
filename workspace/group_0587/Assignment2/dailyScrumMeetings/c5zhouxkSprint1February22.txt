What did I do last time?
    - I worked on JShell and CommandPwd
    - Finish writhing FileSystem

What do I plan to do now?
    - finish JShell
    - start working on the interpreter

Am I blocked on anything?
    - still struggle in  writing the Interpreter
    - confused on if it is necessary on writing more methods to call on in FileSystem
