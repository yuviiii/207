What did I do last time?
    - I worked on JShell,File,FileDirectory and CommandMkdir
    - brainstormed design ideas with team for mkdir,cd,ls and pwd commands. 

What do I plan to do now?
    - finish JShell,File,FileDirectory and CommandMkdir
    - work on new tasks for sprint 2
       

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need Error, FileSystem, Interpreter,Path, Result and Symbo to be completed (or at least prototyped) before I can continue working
