What did I do last time?
    - worked on Error and Path classes
    - brainstormed design ideas with team for cd and ls commands. 

What do I plan to do now?
    - finish Error and Path
    - work on new tasks for sprint 2
        - start and finish pwd, ls, cd.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need File, FileDirectory, Result, and Command to be completed before I can continue working
