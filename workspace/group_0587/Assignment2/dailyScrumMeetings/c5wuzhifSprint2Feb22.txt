What did I do last time?
    - worked on JShell and FileSystem and FileDirectory
    - brainstormed design ideas with team members for File and Error classes. 

What do I plan to do now?
    - still trying to finish JShell and FileOperation
    - work on new tasks for sprint 3
        - start and finish Cat, Ls, Exit

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need Error, File, Interpreter, and Result to be completed (or at least prototyped) before I can continue working
