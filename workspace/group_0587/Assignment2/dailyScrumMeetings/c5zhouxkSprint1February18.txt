What did I do last time?
    - I worked on JShell,FileSystem,and CommandPwd
    - write some rough work for the interpreter

What do I plan to do now?
    - finish JShell and CommandPwd
    - work on new tasks for sprint 2
        - start writing FileSystem

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Difficult to write the Interpreter
    - Need Symbol, File and FileDirectory for me to continue working on FileSystem
